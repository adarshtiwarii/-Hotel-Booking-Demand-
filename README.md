# -Hotel-Booking-Demand-
The Hotel Booking Demand dataset on GitHub is likely associated with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project involving booking information from both city hotels and resort hotels. This dataset includes various attributes such as booking cancellation status, the length of stay, the number of people (adults, children, babies), and more.
Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes details about hotel bookings, such as cancellation status, booking dates, stay durations, guest demographics (adults, children, babies), and hotel-specific features (like room types, parking availability, etc.).
The goal of the analysis is to uncover insights, such as:
How many bookings were canceled.
The booking ratio between city and resort hotels.
Booking trends across years and months.
Most frequent guest countries.
Typical lengths of stay for guests.
The most popular accommodation type (e.g., single, couple, family).
Motivation:

The main motivation behind the analysis is to answer questions related to booking trends, cancellations, and guest preferences.
Tools and Libraries:

Python 3, with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for machine learning), and pycountry for country-related information.
Dataset Information:

The dataset was provided by Jesse Mostipak on Kaggle and contains a variety of features such as:
hotel: Whether the booking is for a city hotel or resort hotel.
is_canceled: Booking cancellation status.
lead_time: Time between booking and arrival.
arrival_date_*: Year, month, week, and day of the booking.
adults, children, babies: Number of guests.
meal: Meal type.
country: The guestâ€™s country.
market_segment: Market segment (e.g., direct, travel agency, etc.).
And other attributes related to booking type, special requests, reservation status, etc.
Results:

Cancellation rate: Approximately 35% of bookings were canceled.
Hotel preference: Over 60% of bookings were for city hotels.
Booking patterns: More bookings occurred in July-August, and fewer bookings were made at the start and end of the year.
Most frequent guest countries: The majority of guests came from Portugal, the UK, France, Spain, and Germany.
Length of stay: Popular stay durations were typically 1-3 nights for resort hotels and 1-7 nights for city hotels.
Accommodation type: Couples (2 adults) were the most common type of booking.
Predictive Modeling:

The project aims to predict whether a booking will be canceled based on the available features using machine learning techniques.
Files in the Repository:

Hotel Booking.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code, documentation, and visualizations.
hotel_bookings.csv: The main dataset file containing all the booking data.
Key Insights and Exploratory Data Analysis
The project provides insights into several aspects of hotel bookings, such as:

The high cancellation rate.
Popular booking months (summer months).
The country distribution of guests.
Common booking types (couples, families).
The repository might also provide details on how the data was cleaned and preprocessed for analysis, and may include steps for feature engineering, data transformation, and model evaluation.
